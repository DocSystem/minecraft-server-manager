# Minecraft Server Manager
Here is Minecraft Server Manager ! The only thing you need to do, it's activating RCON and QUERY in the server.properties file.

You will then be able to see informations about the server (name, version, port...), the online players list, and you will be able to see the server's logs as well as executing commands !

This project is currently in french because it is my native language. I will translate it in English later...
